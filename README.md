## How to run tests

There are multiple ways you can do it. If you wanna run all tests at once from the command line, open up a terminal, navigate to this project's root folder and issue `./gradlew clean test`.

You can do the same on IntelliJ. Open up the `Project` tab (Command+1) > right click the `src/test/java` folder > `Run 'All Tests'`.

Or you can just right click an individual test class and then `Run` it.
